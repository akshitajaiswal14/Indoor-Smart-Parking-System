# Indoor Smart Parking System

This project is a simulation of an indoor parking management system
developed using Python and Computer Vision concepts.

## Objective
To manage parking slots efficiently by showing which slots are free
and which are occupied using a visual interface.

## Features
- Parking slot detection
- Displays free and occupied slots
- QR-based entry and exit simulation
- Visual parking layout
- Easy to understand and run

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Git & GitHub

## Project Files
- par.py → Main program
- mark_spots.py → Used to mark parking slots
- layout.png → Parking layout image
- assets/ → Contains demo video
- .gitignore → Ignored files for GitHub

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required libraries
3. Run mark_spots.py to mark parking slots
4. Run par.py to start the parking simulation

## Output
- Green slots → Free
- Red slots → Occupied
- QR code generated for each car entry
